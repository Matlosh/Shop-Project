# Shop-Project
Android app created in Java for a school project. It simulates small shop with possibilites of ordering, registering a new account and logging in.

### Funcionality
- uses SQLite to internally store created orders, accounts and images
- allows user to create a new account or log in to the old one
- hashes created passwords
- allows to send SMS or Email with contents of earlier created order

### State
Because it is a school project, app is **finished** and won't be further developed.
